      "description": "Eradicating poverty in all its forms is one of the most significant global challenges. Poverty encompasses not just the lack of income but also deprivation of essential services such as healthcare, education, and clean water, along with social exclusion and lack of participation in decision-making processes. This goal aims to ensure equal access to economic resources, financial services, property, and inheritance rights for all, particularly for women, children, and marginalized communities. It emphasizes the need to create sustainable economic growth, promote social protection systems, and improve resilience to natural disasters, climate change, and economic shocks. Through international collaboration, investments in human capital, and sustainable infrastructure, this initiative strives to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030 and reduce inequalities by creating opportunities for everyone, regardless of their background or circumstances. The focus is on fostering inclusive growth that benefits everyone, creating a fairer society where no one is left behind.",
